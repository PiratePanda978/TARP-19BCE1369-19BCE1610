AI-Crop-Management/Smart-Farming
This is a project to design and develop an Automatic Crop monitoring system where sensors are used to collect information in the agricultural field. The different sensors used are temperature and humidity sensor and soil moisture sensor. The information collected by the sensors is sent to the Arduino microcontroller ATmega328.The collected information can be displayed in an LCD display. The information collected by the sensors are updated periodically through Wi-Fi. A GSM module is connected with the microcontroller through which the message about the farm condition is sent to the authorized person.
- In order to maximize water consumption and maintain a green environment, it is important to irrigate more effectively as water supplies become increasingly scarce and polluted. The goal of this project is to create a smart plant watering and monitoring system that analyses and records environmental factors to help plants thrive. The sensors collect and evaluate data regarding changing weather and soil moisture levels before sending notifications to the userâ€™s phone and thingspeak.
- Publishing the end result data on thingspeak .
- Making the plant monitoring easier by using IoT.
- To reduce the wastage of water by avoiding the unwanted watering of the plant
